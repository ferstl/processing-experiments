# processing-experiments
*- Just me trying out some alternative ways for real-time settlement.*

Not much to see here...

## Key Concepts
- Everything that comes in or goes out is persisted
- Processing happens in memory
- Processing recovers from persisted data if the application crashes or is restarted

## Things to do
[ ] Submission: parse/validate/acknowledge (persistent)
[ ] Settlement (irrevocable)
[ ] Delivery
[ ] Handle predated value dates
[ ] System states
[ ] System generated messages
[ ] UI
